    - https://github.com/instrumentisto/docker-mailserver
    - https://rmohan.com/?p=6173
    - https://github.com/tomav/docker-mailserver
    - look at mailinabox and mailcow and https://www.own-mailbox.com/

- need a webmail solution with sieve support and calendar
- dkim key rotation and generation hostname/date in selector

- https://github.com/docker/labs/tree/master/Docker-Orchestration

- user configurable encryption for mail at rest, with time limitations for
  search (e.g., keep mail forever, but only searchable online for 3 months)
    - gpg-mailgate?
