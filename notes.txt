- make sure dovecot/postfix follow ssl best practice
- generated dh parameters secret for dovecot -- use standard?
- make sure both are using recommended elliptic curves
- disable tickets, limit sessions
- fix up dovecot config, simplify image!!!
- disable fail2ban and point nessus at it...
- think about how to wire up fail2ban w/ dovecot/postfix
- better way of extracting text from attachments
- still tries to sync when no replica, so maybe a separate file for that...
- https://imapwiki.org/ImapTest/
- less logging for cron...

- make sure solr is setting up things right, is a volume already defined?

- temporarily pulling dkim, dmarc, postgrey, spf from postfix container,
  should run in own...
- look again at amavis, cluebringer

- mail filtering
  - greylisting with some whitelisting/blacklisting ability
  - spf/dkim/dmarc
  - clamav
  - spamd
  - blacklist and strip some headers

- compare against these, what's better, what's worse:
    - https://github.com/instrumentisto/docker-mailserver
    - https://rmohan.com/?p=6173
    - https://github.com/tomav/docker-mailserver
    - look at mailinabox and mailcow and https://www.own-mailbox.com/

- need a webmail solution with sieve support and calendar
- dkim key rotation and generation hostname/date in selector

- https://github.com/docker/labs/tree/master/Docker-Orchestration

- user configurable encryption for mail at rest, with time limitations for
  search (e.g., keep mail forever, but only searchable online for 3 months)
    - gpg-mailgate?
