- slapd db init mechanism, add back in modules, schema
- postfix postgres? control panel? fusion directory?
- need db init.
- cannot use "users" as slapd group because it already exists
- get ssl working, then make it so everything knows when not to require it
- should service users be able to see password hashes by default?
- next is postfix?

- why do I need to explicitly index now?

- http://wiki.dovecot.org/HowTo/LDAPdiablo
- everything should install ssl-cert and autogenerate
- web admin for postfix
  - fusiondirectory
- clamav
- antispam
- dkim/dmark
- sqlgrey
- cluebringer -- policyd.org?
- policyd
- web service?
- amavis?
- spamassassin
- dkim
- let's encrypt

- look at mailinabox and mailcow

- look at ubuntu mail stack

- also need ssl from lets encrypt

- support features of mailinabox.email and similar!

- virtual users in ldap / postgres?
- provide full text search
- filtering with sieve
- look at different auth methods..
- want replication
- need some way to provide/manage ssl certificates

- look up mocking up test data for dev...
- flocker volume

- cluebringer described at policyd.org

- change schema to better support multi-domain?
- use apache tika for full text?

- will need to get some kind of estimate on memory reqs, esp for solr, tika,
  clamav

- gid on test user is wrong
- solr/tika performance issues

- consider dovecot sdbox/mdbox format instead of maildir
- dsync replication or other backup
