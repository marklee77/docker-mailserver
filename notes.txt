- probably makes most sense to have postfix, dovecot, milters in single
  container and then links to ldap, postgres, solr

- virtual users in ldap
- provide full text search
- filtering with sieve
- look at different auth methods..
- want replication
- need some way to provide/manage ssl certificates
