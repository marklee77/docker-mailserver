- disable fail2ban and point nessus at it...
- think about how to wire up fail2ban w/ dovecot/postfix

- mailing list software (sympa?)
- http://www.onyxbits.de/gnarwl/ ?

- http://trimc-db.blogspot.co.uk/2015/04/apache-solr-and-docker-for-newbies.html

- compare against these, what's better, what's worse:
    - https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized
    - https://github.com/instrumentisto/docker-mailserver
    - https://rmohan.com/?p=6173
    - https://github.com/tomav/docker-mailserver
    - look at mailinabox and mailcow and https://www.own-mailbox.com/

- need a webmail solution with sieve support and calendar
- dkim key rotation and generation hostname/date in selector

- user configurable encryption for mail at rest, with time limitations for
  search (e.g., keep mail forever, but only searchable online for 3 months)
- gpg-mailgate?
