  - ldap
  - postgres
  - postfix
  - dovecot
  - solr
  - spamassassin

- virtual users in ldap
- provide full text search
- filtering with sieve
- look at different auth methods..
- want replication
- need some way to provide/manage ssl certificates

- look up mocking up test data for dev...
- flocker volume

  dspam, spamassassin

- want amavis?

- cluebringer described at policyd.org
